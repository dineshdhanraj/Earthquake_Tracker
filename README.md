# Earthquake_Tracker

I have developed an Earthquake Tracker application that provides users with real-time information on earthquakes in various locations, including their magnitude and other relevant details. The app features two screens that enable users to view additional information about the earthquakes, including their exact location and other details. 

This application has been designed using modern development techniques and has been thoroughly tested to ensure its reliability and accuracy.
